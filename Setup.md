1. Create a tables 'publisher' and 'subscriber' in DyanamoDB. The 'sort key' is 'id' for both.
2. Insert the credentials in the file 'C:\\Users\\{USER}\\.aws\\credentials'. 

Format is as follows:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

3. Load the project in NetBeans and deploy only the Web Tier to GlassFish.

4. Cross fingers and pray that it works.
